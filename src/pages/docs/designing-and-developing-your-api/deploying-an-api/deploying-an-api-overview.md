Stay on top of your API deployments in Postman by connecting to an API gateway. Postman integrates with popular API gateways, including [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/). Once connected to an API gateway, you can view your API deployment status and history from within Postman.

## Connecting to an API gateway

To connect to an API gateway in Postman, select **APIs** in the sidebar, and then select the API and version you want to connect. Select the **Deployments** tab, and then select **AWS API Gateway**.

Enter the required information to configure the API gateway integration. For detailed steps, see [Deploying to an Amazon API Gateway](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/deploying-an-api/deploying-an-api-aws/).

## Viewing API deployments in Postman

After connecting to an API gateway, you can view the deployment history for your API schemas in Postman. Select **APIs** in the sidebar, select an API and version, and then select the **Deployments** tab.

The **Deployments** tab displays details about recent deployments and your API gateway:

* **Amazon API Gateway** - View the active deployment for each stage, recent exports from Postman, and details about each deployment. You can also export or deploy your HTTP API schema from Postman to your gateway. Learn more about [Viewing Amazon API gateway deployments](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/deploying-an-api/deploying-an-api-aws/#viewing-amazon-api-gateway-deployments).
