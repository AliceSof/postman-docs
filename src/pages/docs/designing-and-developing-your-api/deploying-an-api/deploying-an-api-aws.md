[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) enables developers to publish and manage APIs that access AWS and other web services and data sources. Once connected to API Gateway, you can view your API deployment status and history from within Postman. You can also view [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) metrics for each stage to get operational insight into your API.

This integration supports OpenAPI 3.0 schemas for HTTP and REST APIs. You can import a schema from Amazon API Gateway and use it in Postman. For HTTP APIs, you can choose to export your schema from Postman to API Gateway. You can use the AWS console to deploy your exported schema to a stage, or deploy your HTTP API schema directly from Postman to a stage.

## Connecting to Amazon API Gateway

To connect to Amazon API Gateway in Postman, select **APIs** in the sidebar, and then select the API and version you want to connect. Select the **Deployments** tab, and then select **AWS API Gateway**.

<img alt="Connecting to an API Gateway" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/deployments-aws-api-gateway-v9-5.jpg" width="915px"/>

When setting up the connection to API Gateway, you can choose to authenticate by [creating an AWS IAM role](#authenticating-with-an-aws-iam-role) or by [using an AWS access key](#authenticating-with-an-aws-access-key). Follow the steps for your chosen method below. After setting up the connection, you can choose to import a schema from the API Gateway.

> When you delete an API or remove it from a workspace, any configured integrations aren't deleted or removed. On the Postman **Home** page, select **Integrations** and search for "AWS API Gateway" to view the list of [AWS API gateway integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations/service/api_gateway_aws/api_gateway_aws). To delete an integration, select it and then select **Delete Integration**.

### Authenticating with an AWS IAM role

To set up a connection to Amazon API Gateway using an AWS IAM role, select **IAM** under **AWS Authentication Mechanism**.

<img alt="Connecting with AWS IAM role" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/connect-to-api-gateway-with-iam-role-v9-16.jpg" width="520px"/>

Enter a **Nickname** for this integration and select the **AWS API Type** (HTTP or REST).

Next, create an IAM role for Postman in AWS:

1. Open the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) and select **Create role**.
2. Under **Select type of trusted entity**, select **Another AWS account**.
3. Enter Postman's **AWS Account ID**: `258201882842`
4. Under options, select the check box to **Require external ID** and enter the **External ID** from Postman. You can find the external ID under **Step 1: Create an IAM role**.

    > For more information, refer to the [AWS IAM guide on using external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).

5. Select **Next: Permissions**.
6. Select an existing IAM policy or select **Create policy**. If you are creating a policy, use the following JSON code:

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "Stmt909923626743",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "apigateway:GET",
                    "apigateway:PUT",
                    "apigateway:POST",
                    "cloudwatch:GetMetricData"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    This policy will enable exporting and deploying for HTTP API schemas. (Exporting and deploying aren't supported for REST API schemas.) You can customize the `Action` section in the IAM policy based on your needs:

    * `"apigateway:GET"` - (Required) Enables viewing API Gateway deployments for HTTP and REST APIs in Postman.
    * `"apigateway:PUT"` - Enables [exporting](#exporting-and-deploying-your-api) HTTP API schemas to the API Gateway.
    * `"apigateway:POST"` - Enables [deploying](#exporting-and-deploying-your-api) HTTP API schemas to a stage on the API Gateway.
    * `"apigateway:*"` - Assigns all GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE permissions to the IAM role.
    * `"cloudwatch:GetMetricData"` - Enables [viewing CloudWatch metrics](#viewing-cloudwatch-metrics) in Postman.

7. Select **Next: Tags**.
8. Select **Next: Review**.
9. Add a **Role name** and **Role description**, then select **Create role**.

Copy the **Role ARN** from AWS and paste it in Postman under **Step 2: Enter role ARN and region**. Next, enter the **AWS Region** where the API Gateway is located and select the **API Gateway**. When you're ready, select **Connect**.

## Viewing CloudWatch metrics

[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) provides monitoring and observability for APIs deployed to Amazon API Gateway. By default, API Gateway metrics data is automatically sent to CloudWatch in one-minute intervals. After connecting to API Gateway, you can view the last week of CloudWatch metrics in Postman.

From the **Deployments** tab, select the name of a stage to view the CloudWatch dashboard for that stage. The graphs on the dashboard display metrics for latency, integration latency, `4xx` and `5xx` error rates, and count.

* Hover over a data point on a graph to view detailed metrics data.
* Hover over the information icon <img alt="Information icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-information-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="16px"> above a graph to learn more about the metrics in that graph.

<img alt="Viewing CloudWatch metrics" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/api-gateway-cloudwatch-metrics-v9-15.jpg"/>

From the CloudWatch dashboard, you can take the following actions:

* To view metrics for a different stage, select the stage in the dropdown list.
* To view metrics for a different time range, select the time range in the dropdown list.
* To view metrics for your API Gateway in AWS, select **View Dashboard**.
* To view the this stage in AWS, select **View Stage on AWS**.
* To view the latest CloudWatch metrics, select the refresh icon <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-refresh-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="14px">.

### Updating an existing IAM policy for CloudWatch

The Amazon API Gateway integration now supports viewing CloudWatch metrics in Postman. If you previously created an IAM policy when configuring the integration, you need to update the policy to enable CloudWatch metrics. Make sure to add the `"cloudwatch:GetMetricData"` action to your IAM policy:

```json
"Action": [
    "apigateway:GET",
    "apigateway:PUT",
    "apigateway:POST",
    "cloudwatch:GetMetricData"
],
```

## Importing a schema from Amazon API Gateway

You can import an HTTP or REST schema from a connected Amazon API Gateway to your API in Postman. _Importing a schema will replace your current API schema or add a new schema if one doesn't exist._

1. Open your API by selecting **APIs** in the sidebar, and then selecting an API and a version.
1. Select the **Deployments** tab, and then select **Import Schema**.
1. Select the **AWS stage** to import the schema from.
1. Select **Import**.

<img alt="Importing a schema" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/amazon-api-gateway-import-v9-16.jpg" width="650px"/>

## Exporting and deploying your API

Exporting an HTTP API schema makes it available in the connected Amazon API Gateway. After you export a schema from Postman, use the AWS console to configure and deploy the schema to a stage in API Gateway. When exporting, you can also choose to deploy the schema directly from Postman to a stage in the connected API Gateway. Once the schema is deployed, users can start calling the API.

> HTTP API schemas can be exported and deployed from Postman. To deploy a REST API schema, use the AWS console.

1. Open your API by selecting **APIs** in the sidebar, and then selecting an API and a version.
1. Select the **Deployments** tab, and then select **Deploy API**.

    You can also export and deploy your API from the Changelog. Select the changelog icon <img alt="Changelog icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-changelog-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> in the right context bar, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to a release, and then select **Deploy Schema**.

1. Select the version, branch, or release to deploy. Learn more about [versioning an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/) and [creating a release](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/api-releases/#creating-a-release).
1. (Optional) If you would like to deploy the schema to a stage after exporting, select **Deploy on a stage**. Select the AWS stage to deploy the schema to, and enter a brief description.

    > To deploy your schema, your gateway must have at least one route with a configured integration.

1. Select **Deploy**.

    > If you have a problem exporting or deploying, make sure you've assigned both the PUT and POST permissions [in your IAM policy](#authenticating-with-an-aws-iam-role).

<img alt="Deploying an API" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/deploy-api-schema-on-aws-v9-8.jpg" width="502px"/>

> [API Gateway extensions to Open API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-swagger-extensions.html) (vendor extensions) are preserved when pushing and deploying a schema from Postman. Postman merges any extensions present in the API Gateway into the schema before pushing the merged schema to the API Gateway.
