You can check your API definition as you work on it in Postman to help keep your API well defined. As you edit your API definition, Postman lists any syntax errors based on the definition type. Postman also identifies any API governance and security issues based on the rules configured for your team.

## Contents

* [Viewing syntax errors in your API definition](#viewing-syntax-errors-in-your-api-definition)
* [Viewing rule violations in your API definition](#viewing-rule-violations-in-your-api-definition)

## Viewing syntax errors in your API definition

Postman automatically identifies syntax errors as you [edit your API definition](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/defining-an-api/). Errors can include missing fields, malformed field names, incorrect data types, incorrect nesting, or other API definition issues.

Postman can identify syntax errors for OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 and WSDL 1.1 and 2.0 definitions. For Postman to be able to check your definition elements, the JSON or YAML must be well formed.

To view any syntax errors, select **Syntax** next to **Violations found in definition**. Each error shows the error type, the line on which it occurs, and details about the issue. Select an error to highlight it in the editor. You can also get more information by hovering over the error in the editor.

> Sometimes a single error in your definition will cause more than one issue to appear in the list. As you fix the errors, the issues disappear.

## Viewing rule violations in your API definition

> [This feature is available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)

As you create your API definition in the editor, Postman automatically checks it against the [Postman API Governance and API Security](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/) rules configured for your team. Postman displays any rule violations below the editor. Resolving these issues enables you to improve your API definition.

To learn more about the supported API description formats, the rules preconfigured in Postman, and how to create new rules, see [Rule violations in the API definition](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/).

To view any rule violations, select **Rule** next to **Violations found in definition**. Each rule violation is on its own line and includes the violation **Name** and the rule type (**Governance** or **Security**). The number next to the rule name tells you how many times Postman found the rule violation in your API definition.

Select the number to inspect each rule violation. Every instance of the rule violation has a brief description of the issue and the line in the file where the rule violation occurs. When you select a rule violation, Postman highlights the section of the definition that triggered it.

To learn more about the rule violation and get information about how to fix it, select **Possible fix** next to the rule description. This will open the relevant Learning Center page.

When you make updates to your API definition, Postman re-checks it. If your changes resolve the issue, Postman removes the rule violation from the list.

### Hiding rule violations

To hide a rule violation for the API definition, do the following:

1. Select <img alt="Hide rule violation icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-eye-crossed-out.jpg#icon" width="18px"> **Hide** next to the rule violation.

    <img alt="Hide a rule violation in your API definition" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-definition-hide-rule-violation-v10.1.jpg"/>

1. Select a reason that you want to hide it, then select **Hide**.

    <img alt="" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-definition-hide-rule-violation-choose-reason-v10.jpg" width="300px"/>

This will hide the rule violation for the current API. If there is more than one violation of a specific rule, you can hide each instance individually.

> To hide a rule violation globally, you can use either [configurable API Governance rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/) or [configurable API Security rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-security-rules/).

When you or another member of your team hides a rule violation, Postman shows a message in the editor's **Rule** tab to indicate how many are hidden.

To turn a rule back on later, do the following:

1. Select **Review**.
1. Review your hidden rules and select the eye icon <img alt="Eye icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/eye.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the one you want to turn back on.
