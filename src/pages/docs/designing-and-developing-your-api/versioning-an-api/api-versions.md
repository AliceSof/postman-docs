When you create a new API in Postman, it also creates the initial version you entered during the API creation. You can create new versions from scratch or based on an existing version. Each API version has its own **API version** page, which you can find on the API Overview page or in the sidebar.

## Creating versions

To create a new version of an API:

1. Go to the API **Overview** page. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the upper right corner and select **Create version**.
1. Enter a version name.
1. Select **Make this version available for consumers** if you want the new version to be visible. Otherwise, it's only visible to users with Editor access to the API.
1. If you want to base this version on existing elements, select **Show more options**. In **Copy elements from a previous version**, choose a previous version of the API. Then select the elements you want to copy to your new API.
    > Copying an element creates a new copy in your workspace. The new element will have the new version number appended to its name, such as `my-docs-2.0.0`. The new elements will be linked to the new version of the API.
1. Select __Create Version__. Your new version will open in the API Builder.

## Renaming and deleting versions

You can rename, edit, or delete an API version using the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the sidebar. Editing an API enables you to change the name, status, and visibility at once.

   > When you delete an API version, the collections, monitors, mocks, and environments linked to it won't be deleted or removed.
