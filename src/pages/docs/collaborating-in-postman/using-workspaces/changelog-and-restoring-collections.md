> **[Changelog is available on Postman Basic, Professional, and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**

Each Postman Collection has a changelog that covers create, update, transfer, and delete events. You can use the changelog to keep track of updates you and other collaborators make to your private and team collections. The changelog also enables you to roll back a collection and restore it to an earlier point in time.

## Contents

* Viewing changes to a [collection](#viewing-the-collection-changelog), [workspace](#viewing-workspace-activity), or [team](#viewing-team-activity)
* [Restoring collections](#restoring-collections)
* [Exporting team activity](#exporting-team-activity-to-other-platforms)
* [Next steps](#next-steps)

## Viewing the collection changelog

To review the changelog for a collection in Postman, open the collection and select the changelog icon <img alt="Changelog icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-changelog-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> on the right.

The changelog provides a chronological list of collection activities. You can view the time and date changes occurred, the users who were involved, and what parts of the collection were affected.

Postman groups changes made within several minutes of each other into sessions for readability. You can select a session in the changelog to review its changes individually.

Select **View changes** under an item to view the collection diff. If a diff is too large to view in the changelog, you can hover over the diff and select **View more** to open it in a new tab.

## Viewing workspace activity

You can [access the activity feed in Postman](#accessing-the-activity-feed-from-postman). The activity feed will show information on who added or removed collections, environments, or entities from the workspace as well as members joining and leaving the workspace. You can [filter this information](#filtering-the-activity-feed) directly within the activity feed.

You can also [view who's active in your workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#seeing-who-is-in-your-workspace).

### Accessing the activity feed from Postman

To access the activity feed in Postman, select the Overview tab and go to the **Activity** section to see the events that have occurred within the workspace.

### Filtering the activity feed

Filtering the activity feed allows you to display the relevant information directly instead of having to scroll through the feed. You can choose to filter by [user](#filtering-by-user) or by [entity](#filtering-by-entity) (Workspace, API, Collection, Environment).

To reset your search, select **Clear filters** at the right of the activity feed. You can also refresh the results by selecting **Refresh** at the right of the activity feed.

#### Filtering by user

Filtering by user will only display the actions the specified user carried out.
To filter by user, select **User** at the top of the activity feed and select the user or users. You can search for a specific user by typing their name in the search field. Once you have selected the user, select **Apply**.

> The user list will only show the users that are part of the workspace, not all team members.

#### Filtering by entity

Filtering by entity will only display the actions carried out on the selected entity type. Available entities are `Workspace`, `API`, `Collection`, and `Environment`.
To filter by entity, select **Entity** at the top of the activity feed and select the entity or entities. You can search for a specific entity by typing its name in the search field. Once you have selected the entity, select **Apply**.

> You can access the changelog of a specific collection by selecting **View Changelog** next to actions on collections.

## Viewing team activity

You can review the activity for a team with a Postman Basic, Professional, or Enterprise account. In [Postman](https://go.postman.co/), use the __Workspaces__ dropdown to select your team, then go to the __Activity__ feed to view the events.

## Restoring collections

You can use the [changelog](#viewing-the-collection-changelog) to restore a collection to an earlier point in time.

To restore a collection from the changelog:

1. Select a session to expand it.
2. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the change you'd like to restore your collection to, then select **Restore to this change**.

    <img alt="Restore from changelog" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/changelog-restore-v9.16.jpg" width="350px"/>

Restoring a collection from the changelog reverts it to the point immediately after your selected change occurred.

> If you'd like to restore a deleted collection, see [Recovering a deleted collection](/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/#recovering-a-deleted-collection).

## Exporting team activity to other platforms

With a Postman Basic, Professional, or Enterprise account, you can pipe team activity feeds to external communication channels:

* [Slack integration](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/)
* [Microsoft Teams integration](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/microsoft-teams/)
