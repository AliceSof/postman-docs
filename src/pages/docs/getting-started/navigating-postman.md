### Search Postman

To search in Postman, select __Search Postman__ in the header then enter your search terms. You can also use the keyboard shortcut **⌘+K** or **Ctrl+K**. To change the scope of your search to your personal or team space or the Public API Network, select **All of Postman** and choose the desired scope. You can also change the scope of your search to **Workspaces**, **Collections**, **APIs**, or **Teams**.

> For signed-out users, search results only include public resources.

If you don't find what you are looking for in the list of results, select __Search all workspaces, collections, APIs and teams__ and you can find all the results in one page.

<img alt="Search all" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/search-all-workspaces-collections-and-teams-v9.5.jpg"/>

The __Search results__ page lists the scope and element type. You can change these options to further filter your results.

You can also sort results using __Sort by__ on the right by selecting _Most relevant_ (default), _Most views_, or _Most recent_.

Depending on the element type, the search results contain different information:

* For _workspaces_, the search result contains the workspace type, summary, who published it, and when was it published.
* For _collections_, the search result contains the workspace type, whether the collection is a fork or not, who published it, and when was it published.
* For _APIs_, the search result contains the name and summary of the API, the API's owner (either an individual user or a team), and the workspace type.
* For _teams_, the search result contains the name and summary of the team. Selecting the team name redirects you to the team profile.

## Sidebar

The Postman sidebar provides access to the fundamental elements of Postman:

* [Collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/)
* [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/)
* [Environments](/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#creating-environments)
* [Mock servers](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)
* [Monitors](/docs/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/)
* [History](#history)

<img alt="Sidebar focused on Collections" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/navigating-postman-sidebar-v9.15.jpg" width="350px"/>

To hide the sidebar, select the hide sidebar icon <img alt="Hide sidebar icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-hide-sidebar-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> from the [footer](#footer).

### History

To access the requests you've made, select __History__ in the sidebar. When you're signed in to Postman, your history [syncs](/docs/getting-started/syncing/) across your devices.

Select a request to open it again in a new tab. You can select more than one request by pressing **⌘** or **Ctrl** and selecting the requests.

<img alt="History Request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/history-request-v9.jpg" width="350px"/>

Your history also includes [collection runs](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/). These remain as the summarized version of the run and aren't logged as single requests.

* Select the add icon __+__ to save the request to a collection.
* Select the delete icon <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-delete-v9.jpg#icon" width="12px"> to remove the request from your history.
* Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> to access other actions, including creating a monitor, documentation, or mock server for the request.

#### Clearing your history

To remove all requests from your history, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> next to the History search bar, then select **Clear all**.

#### Saving responses in history

To save request responses in your history, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> next to the History search bar, then turn on **Save Responses**.

> You can't use the __Save Responses__ option with requests from [Collection Runner](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).

## Main work area

Whether you're working with a collection, an API, or another element type, the center section of Postman is where you do the majority of your work. [Tabs](#tabs) enable you to organize your work, while the [right sidebar](#right-sidebar) gives you access to element-specific tools like documentation, and the [environment selector and environment quick look](#environment-selector-and-environment-quick-look) enable you to manage variables.

### Tabs

Tabs allow you to organize and work between requests.

#### Opening a new tab

To open a new tab, select __+__ in the middle of the screen.

> You can also select **⌘+T** or **Ctrl+T** to open a new tab.

<img alt="Open a new tab" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/open-new-tab.jpg" width="450px"/>

If you open a request and don't edit or send it, then open another request, the second tab replaces the first tab. When the tab is in preview mode, it displays in italics.

You can set whether Postman opens requests in new tabs. Select the settings icon <img alt="Settings icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-settings-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the header, then select **General**. Under **Requests**, select **Always open requests in a new tab** to turn this option on or off.

#### Saving or discarding changes

If a tab has unsaved changes, Postman displays a dot next to the tab name. Select <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-save.jpg#icon" width="16px"> **Save** to save the changes. To close the tab and discard changes, select the close icon <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-close.jpg#icon" width="16px"> then select **Don't save**.

#### Viewing conflicts

A tab will alert you to a conflict if you or a collaborator changes its contents in another tab or workspace. Postman prompts you to resolve any conflicts that happen.

<img alt="Tab displaying a conflict" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/tab-conflict.jpg" width="300px"/>

#### Managing tabs

You can have many tabs open at the same time. To rearrange your open tabs, select and drag them in the desired order.

To manage your open tabs or to access recently closed tabs, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> to open a menu with action options:

* **Recently Closed Tabs** - Shows tabs that you closed recently. Select one to reopen it.
* **Duplicate Selected Tab** - _(Desktop app only)_ Duplicates the current tab. This doesn't create a copy of the request, so when you duplicate a tab any edits you make are reflected in the original request.
* **Close Selected Tab** - Closes the current tab. If the tab has unsaved changes, Postman asks if you want to save before closing.
* **Force Close Selected Tab** - Closes the current tab without saving any changes.
* **Close All but Selected Tab** - Closes all tabs except the one you are currently working in.
* **Close All Tabs** - Closes all tabs. If any tabs contain unsaved changes, Postman will ask if you want to save before closing.
* **Force Close All Tabs** - Closes all tabs without saving any changes.

<img alt="Manage tabs using the actions menu" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/manage-tabs.jpg" width="300px"/>

You can also manage your open tabs or open a new tab by right-clicking on an existing tab.

> **Closing unsaved tabs.** You can set whether Postman asks whether you want to save when you close a tab that has changes. Select the settings icon <img alt="Settings icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-settings-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the header, then select **General**. Under **Requests**, select **Always ask when closing unsaved tabs** to turn this option on or off.

If you have a lot of tabs open, they might overflow the area of the tab bar. To go to tabs that are outside the viewable area, select the arrows to the left or right of the tab bar.

<img alt="Scroll to view tabs" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/tab-navigation-scroll.jpg" width="800px"/>

### Right sidebar

The right sidebar gives you access to more tools, including documentation, comments, code snippets, and request information, based on which kind of Postman element you select.
