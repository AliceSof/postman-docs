            }
        ]
    }
```

## Filter for a customer's recurring subscription payments

### FQL

``` javascript
payments[description='recurring subscription']
```

### Result

 ``` json
 [
    {
        "invoice_number": "101301",
        "date": "2022-09-11T16:12:34.494Z",
        "description": "recurring subscription",
        "amount": 110.48
    },
    {
        "invoice_number": "101303",
        "date": "2022-10-11T16:12:34.683Z",
        "description": "recurring subscription",
        "amount": 110.48
    }
]
```

## Filter for the invoice numbers of recurring payments

### FQL

 ``` javascript
 payments[description='recurring subscription'].invoice_number
 ```

### Result

 ```json
 ["101301","101303"]
 ```

## When your filter matches a single record

It returns a single record, not an array.

### FQL

 ``` javascript
 payments[description='recurring subscription deluxe'].invoice_number
 ```

### Result

``` json
"101304"
```

## Checking if a field contains a value

### FQL

``` javascript
$contains(payments[0].description, 'recurring')
```

### Result

``` json
true
```
