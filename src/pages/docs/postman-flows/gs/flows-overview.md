_Postman Flows_ is a visual tool for creating API workflows. You can use flows to chain requests, handle data, and create real-world workflows in your Postman workspace.

The following topics will help you get started or learn about core concepts of Postman Flows.

## Quick start

* [Step-by-step guide to building your first flow](/docs/postman-flows/tutorials/building-your-first-flow/)
* [Running requests in sequence](/docs/postman-flows/tutorials/running-requests-in-sequence/)
* [Passing data between blocks](/docs/postman-flows/tutorials/passing-data-between-blocks/)

## Blocks

Blocks are the basic units used to create a flow. Every block has a specific purpose, such as performing tasks, creating data, transforming data, and much more.

### Block fundamentals

Every block has either an input, an output, or both. You can pass a message packet from one block to another. Blocks can perform tasks, have values, or run an operation. For more information on each block, see [Types of Blocks](#types-of-blocks).

> A block isn't a function but a process.

### Block anatomy

![Block anatomy](https://assets.postman.com/postman-labs-docs/block/updated-block-anatomy.png)

1. **Name** - Name of the block.

2. **Request to run** - Which request from your collection is going to be run.

3. **Send event input** - Starts running the block when this port receives an input.

4. **Environment** - Which Postman environment to use.

5. **Body Type** - Schema the request uses.

6. **Variables** - The variables that are either provided in the flow or from the environment.

7. **Success** - When the block returns a successful status code it emits the response data.

8. **Failure** - When the block returns an unsuccessful status code it emits the response data.

### Types of blocks

There are three types of blocks:

* **Task blocks** perform a particular asynchronous task.
* **Data blocks** create data of a specific type.
* **Logic blocks** perform actions on data to transform them. These are synchronous in nature.

## Messages

A _message_ is a single packet of data. A message could be a string or number, or it could be a large complex data structure like a list of users, or an entire movie.

Data structures like lists can also be converted to streams which can be processed by blocks asynchronously.

> When a message flows from one block to another, the actual data doesn't move but a pointer to the message is passed along.

Postman Flows is a dataflow language, which means it understands all kinds of values and associates types with data. Flows is a hybrid typed language, so it performs static type checking to provide features like auto-complete and early warning. Flows also performs some dynamic type checking during execution.

Because most flow programmers have a JavaScript or TypeScript background, or are programming in an API-First language for the first time, the vocabulary of the types resembles JavaScript and TypeScript.
